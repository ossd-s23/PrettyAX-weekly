We presented our Jarvis project!!

### Jarvis

I am very happy with how our project turned out and the amount of contributions that we had to Jarvis as a group. I really enjoyed
working with my group and on this project. I can say that I am proud of the work that we did. Although not all of the PRs
that we raised were accepted, the contributions we made to the project so far both in code and in documentation have helped make Jarvis
a much more user-friendly and functional program for people to use. Overall, I really like working on this project with my group and would actually
want to continue contributing by seeing if it's possible to become a maintainer for the project.
