#### Jarvis project
This week our team met again and we ensured that all of us had it installed and running on our machines. Besides that, I went into each feature of Jarvis to find out which features have broken or have bugs since they were implemented. Aside from that, we also contacted the owner of the project and introduced ourselves in the chat that includes the contributing community.

#### Jim Hall's talk
On monday, Jim Hall came to talk to us about FreeDOS. It is extremely interesting to hear about the project from the creator himself, his design choices and why he made them. FreeDOS, to me is quite an interesting software, it is also around the same age as me. Seeing that it has a command line interface, it actually has the same interface as our Jarvis project.
