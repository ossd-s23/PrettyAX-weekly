# Week 3 

## In class activity with Github
On Monday, we had an in class activity which taught us how to use github. I have had previous experiences working with Github but this class helped remind me regarding using various commands such as git pull, commit, rebase, push.
We learned that Git is a Version Control System where it records all of the changes for files that are on the user's repo. On Github, we can see all the changes and all the versions of the file that a user has. This is very helpful as 
it allows users to go back to previous versions that they were working on, in case the new version does not work and a roll back is required. 

In the in class activity, I initially had difficulty setting up SSH and finding my public key so that I can give it to Github. But once I figured it out, it was pretty straightforward. I didn't have much trouble with the rest of the activity and I must say that I relearned the basics of Github. 

## Add-on project
For the add-on project, my group and I have decided to make a PDF viewer that is specific for Brightspace. We've decided it as due to Brightspace's layout, sometimes PDFs can be hard to view as the rest of Brightspace's layout takes up too much space.
Therefore, we wanted to make an extension that directly accesses the PDF and opens it in another webpage. We split up the work and came back together on Saturday and walked through everything from the repo to the demo to the presentation.
