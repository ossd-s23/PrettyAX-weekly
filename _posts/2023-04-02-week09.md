### Group work: 
This week, we had a meeting to talk about the issues that we can address. We subsequently handed in issues into the issues tab of the Jarvis project.
I've subsequently made progress with one of the issues, where I created documentation and fixed a typo regarding the feature on Jarvis. I have yet to push my changes to the main branch, I would like my teammates to look through my changes before I push. During the meeting,
we also made further plans to implement new features for Jarvis.
