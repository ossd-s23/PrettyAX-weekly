title: "Week 13: Open Source within the Industry, Jarvis Groupwork"
---

# Open Source Within Industry 

It was very interesting to see Open Source being used in the industry. I learned that RedHat was the one that made open source popular within the industry. It is also interesting to see that businesses adopting this model as you would think that they would want to make their code private and not open source to prevent competitor analysis as well as being the most profit driven.

# Jarvis Groupwork
My biggest accomplishments would be to identify the features of Jarvis that was not working and be able to place them into the issues tab of the Git project.
The other accomplishment would be to submit a PR for the project to actively improve Jarvis.
A surprise regarding our project would be to see that the moderator may not be the quickest when it comes to approving issues and PRs.
