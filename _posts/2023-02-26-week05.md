title: Week 5 - Mek Kerples and Internet Archive
---

On Wednesday, we had a guest speaker come into our class. Mek Karpeles, a guest speaker from the Open Library, came to talk about the project and its importance. His talk emphasized the need for accessible information and how the Open Library is working towards that goal. He also highlighted the challenges that the Open Library faces in digitizing books, such as copyright laws and the availability of resources.
Personally, I have not heard about Internet Archive neither have I heard about Open Library. I think Open Library is a very interesting project that I would love to contribute to. 
Mek was very friendly and he seemed very welcoming of new contributors, therefore, I will look deeper into how I can make a contribution to Open Library.
