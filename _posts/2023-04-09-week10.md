title: Week 10, Cathedral and other group's works

## Other group's works
I realised that the work that the other groups are doing are all very useful. It was extremely informative for everyone to go in front of the class and present what everyone has done so far, including integrating 
into the new community as well as contributing to the project. It was extremely heartening to see so many projects whose purpose was to make people's lives easier. It was also nice to see that everyone was getting along
with their project and there were not many hiccups along the way.

## Jarvis Project Progress

We've narrowed down on a few issues and we've created PRs for the issues and a moderator of the project has replied to us and told us that we can go ahead and implement a fix for one of the issues.

## The Cathedral and the Bazaar

My favorite would still be Bazaar where release often and so more bugs and be spotted as there are more users using it. I think that format is still better as the frequent users are the ones that need the 
project the most and also serving them and fixing bugs for the most frequent users should be the priority as they are the main demographic. The other format of Cathedral where it is infrequent would feel
more distant between the contributors and the users as I think there could be a disconnect with what users need and what contributors provide.
