# Week 6 blog

Looking at all the open source projects that we've seen in class and also looking at the ones that I am interested in and would like to contribute. I find it 
kind of hard to find the "perfect" project to make contributions to. What I mean by this is that the active projects would be very active and therefore the 
issues that are present may be solved by the time I get to it. While there are also projects that I've looked into that are also pretty much completed projects
where the main product for the project is completed and there are no bugs/issues but there are feature improvements that can be done. I am unsure as to which project
I should start with.

Besides that, I am excited to start working on an open source project as I am interested in making my first contribution on a project. Making an actual
contribution such as fixing an issue is what I am most excited about.

I would say the biggest challenge right now would be finding appropriate projects to make contributions to. Similar to the issues I mentioned earlier, maybe
the best way to start is to just find a project and start. Since starting is the hardest part.
